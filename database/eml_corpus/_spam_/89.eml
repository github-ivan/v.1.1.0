>From Miss Elena Bamata
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire.=A0

=A0
=A0
=A0=A0Dearest One,
=A0
Good thing to write you. I have a proposal for you. This however is not man=
datory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will.
=A0
=A0I am Miss Elena Bamata, the only daughter of my late parents Mr and Mrs =
Bamata. My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a Cocoa Merchant,=
 Diamond and Gold Dealer) who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during=
 his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France duri=
ng one of his business trips abroad on 2nd March 2008.Though his sudden dea=
th was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of =
his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother=
 died when I was just 4 years old and since then my father took me so speci=
al.
=A0
Before his death on 2nd March 2008 he called the secretary who accompanied =
him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Seventeen=A0Million=
, Seven=A0Hundred Thousand United State Dollars.(USD$17.7000) deposited in=
=A0SECURITY COMPANY in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire.
=A0=A0
He further told him that he deposited the Consignment in my name as the nex=
t of kin and he registered the Consignment as Family Valuables and finally =
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession to=
 handle all the necessary legal documents of the Consignment which he depos=
ited in the SECURITY COMPANY and he instructed the lawyer to handover the d=
ocuments to me whenever I need it.
=A0
I am=A0 a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do.
Now I want a foreign partner who assist me to retrieve this consignment fro=
m the SECURITY=A0COMPANY in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire .=20
=A0
This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant=
 political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually broug=
ht sorrow to my life.I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in =
this regards.
=A0
Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.=20
=A0
Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
=A0
1.Can you kindly tell me what the type of a profitable venture this fund wi=
ll uesd to invest avoid waste of it.
=A02). Can you honestly help me as your daughter?=20
3). Can I completely trust you?=20
4). What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you af=
ter you have collected this consigment on my behalf?
=A0
Thank you so much.=20
=A0
Yours Sincerely,=20
