 ments - 
driven by aging, expanding populations and improving standards of living - have increased the burden on healthcare systems, public and private. Those events have particularly affected countries whose healthcare is mostly funded by the state. Developing nations are also finding it challenging to meet the increasing expectations for healthcare, despite rapid economic growth. Our new report covers pharma pricing and reimbursement in detail, showing the implications of P&amp;R developments on the pharma industry and market in leading countries.<br><br>Worldwide, governments have instigated mechanisms to limit or lower prices of prescription medicines. Those measures include reference pricing, applying cost-benefit analyses and use of other health technology assessments. Those and other P&amp;R policies will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing from 2010 onwards. As our new report - Developments in Pricing and Reimbursement in Leading Pharma Markets 2010-2020 - shows, there are many opportunities for pharmaceutical companies to increase revenues and be innovative, finding ways to accommodate P&amp;R regulations.<br><br>Our new report discusses P&amp;R in the following markets, from 2010 looking ahead:<br>• US<br>• Japan<br>• Germany<br>• France<br>• UK<br>• Italy<br>• Spain.<br><br>In addition, our report covers the expanding role of generic drugs in those markets. Healthcare providers and payers have become increasingly sensitive to drug prices. Governments are using economic evaluations to assess the benefits of prescription drugs, especially biotechnological products. This latest report from visiongain analyses the main issues affecting P&amp;R decisions within the developed pharmaceutical markets. It discusses the principal changes that have been observed and focuses on the present and future consequences for those markets.<br><br><br>Comprehensive analysis of pharma pricing and reimbursement in leading markets<br><br>Developments in Pricing and Reimbursement in Leading Pharma Mar!
