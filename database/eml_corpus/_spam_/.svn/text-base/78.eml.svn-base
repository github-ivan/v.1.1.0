Hello,


Good a thing to write you. I have a proposal for you-this however
is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour
against your will. I am Abiba,21years old and the only daughter of
my late parents Mr.and Mrs Faki Yao My father was a highly
reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the
capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he
passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips
abroad on 12th.Febuary 2005. 

Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been
masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that
time.But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4
years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his
death on Febuary 12 2005 on our to the hospital and he disclosed to
me secretly that he has the sum of Sixteen million,seven hundred
thousand United State Dollars.
(USD$16.700,000) left in fixed deposit account in one of the
leading banks in Abidjan Cote d ivoire Africa . 

I am just 21 years old and really don't know what to do.Now I want
an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. This is
because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant
political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father
actually has brought sorrow to my life. 

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this
regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now
permit me to ask these few questions:- 1. Can you honestly help me
as your daughter?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for
you after the money is in your account?
Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,
Abiba Yao.
