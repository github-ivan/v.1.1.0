					<P>Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.</P><P>
The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.)</P><P>
Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was
too small to survive on <br>
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.</P><P>
Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished;.

					<P>US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout. American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. "In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time," said the Journal. "Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price,
not time." In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United. </P><P>
Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. "The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,"
said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration. </P><P>
The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. "The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees" while "European authorities have acted more wisely," letting Swissair and Sabena "go to the wall," said the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and
Canada 3000. Paging Charles Darwin to the white courtesy phone... - Jen Muehlbauer</P>

					<P>The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which opened yesterday in San Francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellows ever to lie down with a stuffed penguin: Microsoft and Sun. These are companies that once referred to Linux as a "bathtub of code" (Sun) and "a cancer" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News.</P><P>
Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year.</P><P>
Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: "Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon."</P><P>
Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- "a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes," deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: "Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow."</P><P>
Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called "Solinux." How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems
demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux.</P><P>
The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. "Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux," Poletti reported. And you thought Microsoft hated Linux? - Keith Dawson</P><P>

					<P>Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.</P><P>
IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. ("Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...") Only after "months of surreptitious layoff notices" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to "rebalancing" and more employees than
expected taking voluntary layoffs. </P><P>
Sorry, we're still back on "rebalancing." Did IBM "rightsize" last quarter, too?</P><P>
IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. </P><P>
OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for "stealth layoffs," as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin. </P><P>
It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first half was 
up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost. </P><P>
Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the "Curious George" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable
sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper. </P><P>
Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean. The working title? "How I Was Betrayed."  - Deborah Asbrand </P><P>

[Wed May 30 12:00:35 2012] WARNING - HTML_PARSER: Unrecognized entity &P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
"self-fulfilling prophecy" does spring to mind. </P><P>
So does the phrase "gloom and doom." "Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States," said the San Jose Mercury News. "Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again," wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines "demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom"
and "disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond." </P><P>
OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more.</P><P>
The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement "Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market." And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, "This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse." Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that "the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty." 
</P><P>
We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. The "bottom" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify.</P><P>
Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, "If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."</P><P>
The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- "without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world," quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter.</P><P>
One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. "Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially," the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May
2001.</P><P>
Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson</P><P>

					<P>Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.</P><P>
IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. ("Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way...") Only after "months of surreptitious layoff notices" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to "rebalancing" and more employees than
expected taking voluntary layoffs. </P><P>
Sorry, we're still back on "rebalancing." Did IBM "rightsize" last quarter, too?</P><P>
IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. </P><P>
OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for "stealth layoffs," as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin. </P><P>
It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first half was 
up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost. </P><P>
Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the "Curious George" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable
sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper. </P><P>
Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean. The working title? "How I Was Betrayed."  - Deborah Asbrand </P><P>

[Wed May 30 12:01:10 2012] WARNING - HTML_PARSER: Unrecognized entity &P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
"self-fulfilling prophecy" does spring to mind. </P><P>
So does the phrase "gloom and doom." "Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States," said the San Jose Mercury News. "Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again," wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines "demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom"
and "disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond." </P><P>
OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more.</P><P>
The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement "Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market." And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, "This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse." Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that "the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty." 
</P><P>
We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. The "bottom" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify.</P><P>
Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, "If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."</P><P>
The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- "without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world," quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter.</P><P>
One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. "Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially," the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May
2001.</P><P>
Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson</P><P>

					<P>US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout. American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. "In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time," said the Journal. "Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price,
not time." In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United. </P><P>
Speaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. "The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,"
said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration. </P><P>
The basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. "The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees" while "European authorities have acted more wisely," letting Swissair and Sabena "go to the wall," said the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and
Canada 3000. Paging Charles Darwin to the white courtesy phone... - Jen Muehlbauer</P>

					<P>The LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, which opened yesterday in San Francisco, will host two of the strangest bedfellows ever to lie down with a stuffed penguin: Microsoft and Sun. These are companies that once referred to Linux as a "bathtub of code" (Sun) and "a cancer" (Microsoft), according to Sun's hometown paper the San Jose Mercury News.</P><P>
Both companies are taking Linux seriously despite the absolute numbers. By January 2, 2001, Microsoft had made as much on server software as all Linux vendors put together would reap in the entire year.</P><P>
Honors for the best attention-grabber on Microsoft's presence at the show go to Brier Dudley, who opened his piece for the Seattle Times this way: "Microsoft executive Peter Houston wasn't too worried about the reception he'd get at LinuxWorld ... until he heard about the pie cannon."</P><P>
Wired informed us that the section of LinuxWorld where Microsoft will be holding the fort is dubbed the Rookery -- "a place where you can watch companies hatch and grow right before your eyes," deadpanned reporter Michelle Delio, quoting Microsoft's Houston: "Hatching isn't exactly on the agenda, but I certainly hope to grow."</P><P>
Turning to Sun, Unspun notes that five years ago a joke press release circulated on the Net claiming that Linux creator Linus Torvalds, then still living in Finland, was moving to Silicon Valley to work for Sun. The joke was that Sun had decided to scrap its Solaris operating system and instead concentrate on a version of Linux, to be called "Solinux." How time does make April fools of us all: Linus Torvalds is now thriving in Silicon Valley (at Transmeta), and yesterday Sun Microsystems
demonstrated Sun Linux 5.0. and introduced its first general-purpose servers running Linux.</P><P>
The Merc ran a comprehensive wrap of Sun's evolving attitude toward the upstart operating system. Sun has little choice but to embrace Linux, wrote reporter Therese Poletti, because some of its traditional Wall Street customers were deserting it. "Several investment banks have tossed out whole sections of Sun servers and replaced them with Intel-based servers running Linux," Poletti reported. And you thought Microsoft hated Linux? - Keith Dawson</P><P>

					<P>Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.</P><P>
The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.)</P><P>
Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce competition from discounters, a too-small area of service concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was
too small to survive on <br>
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.</P><P>
Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has vanished;.

[Wed May 30 12:01:44 2012] WARNING - HTML_PARSER: Unrecognized entity &P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
"self-fulfilling prophecy" does spring to mind. </P><P>
So does the phrase "gloom and doom." "Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States," said the San Jose Mercury News. "Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again," wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines "demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom"
and "disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond." </P><P>
OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more.</P><P>
The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement "Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market." And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, "This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse." Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that "the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty." 
</P><P>
We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. The "bottom" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify.</P><P>
Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, "If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."</P><P>
The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- "without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world," quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter.</P><P>
One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. "Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially," the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May
2001.</P><P>
Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson</P><P>
