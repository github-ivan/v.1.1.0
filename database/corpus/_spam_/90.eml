>From Miss Joanna

I am Joanna the only child of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.johnson Morrison. =
My father was ahighly reputable busnness magnet who operated in the capital=
 during his days.=20

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of h=
is business trips abroad on the September 2006. Though his sudden death was=
 linked or rather suspected to have been master minded by an uncle of his w=
ho traveled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died =
when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my father took me so special. Befo=
re his death on September 2006, he called me and informed me that he has th=
e sum of Seven Million, Four Hundred Thousand United State Dollars. (USD $ =
7,400,000.00) left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks her=
e. He further told me that he deposited the money in my name, and also gave=
 me all the necessary but legal documents to this fund with the bank.=20

I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really do not kno=
w what to do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this fund=
s and after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in your coun=
try till such a time that it will be convinient for me to return back home =
if I so desire. This is because I have Suffered a lot of set backs as a res=
ult of incessant political crisishere in my CONUTRY. The death of my father=
 actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want to invest the fund under y=
our care because I am ignorant of business world.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your su=
ggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few=
 questions:

1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?=20
2. Can I completely trust you? Please, consider this and get back to me as =
soon as=20

possible.Immedaitely I confirm your willingness, I will send to you The Det=
ail And Also inform you more details involved in this matter.=20

Kind Regards,=20
